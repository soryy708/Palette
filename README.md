## Glossary

* Color harmony - also known as color chords, defined as pleasing combinations of two or more colors. These can be calculated using a relationship on a hue wheel.
* Complementary colors - directly opposite one another on the hue wheel. The chord has high contrast, which is good for accents.
* Triadic colors - three colors at equal distance from one another on the hue wheel.
* Tetradic colors - four colors formed by two sets of complementary colors 60 degrees apart on the hue wheel.
* Analogous colors - Colors directly adjacent, 30 degrees apart
* Neutral colors - Colors directly adjacent, 15 degrees apart
